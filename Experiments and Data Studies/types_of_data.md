# Different Types of Data

## CS Types of Data
We've talked about different types of data before when thinking about writing code. Let's review what *type* means in the context of computer science.
1. What are some different types of data you've worked with? _Hint: what's a class?_
We have worked with ints, floats, strings
2. What happens if you try to average a list of strings?
You cant
3. Why is a variable's type important?
It allows you to do certain operations depending on the variable type


## Statistical Types of Data
In statistics, a variable's type means something different compared to what we've seen in computer science.
1. What is a statistical variable, and how is it different from a computer science variable?
2. Why is a statistical variable's type important?

### Vocabulary
I encourage you to search online for these answers! Try to respond in your own words.
1. What is the difference between a **quantitative** and a **qualitative** variable?
Quantitative is a value, qualitative variable is a description 
2. What is the difference between a **discrete** and a **continuous** variable? Are these quantitative or qualitative?
They are quantitative data types. continuous means they are *measuring* variables, discrete means they are *counting* variables (discrete can be booleans, quantity of somethings)
3. What is the difference between a **nominal** and an **ordinal** variable? Are these quantitative or qualitative?
Ordinal is variables that gives the order; the possible data values have an inherent order (natural number value data, for example. Not satisfied to very satisfied, (not quantitative, but still ordinal)). These can be either quantitative or qualitative. 

Nominal is non-ordered data. usually not categorical. A short answer to a question. typically qualitative. 
4. What is a qualitative variable that's not **categorical**?
Short response is qualitative but not categorical; 
categorical is data where there are a set of specific possible values-duplicates might be important, similar to discrete data, 


Not mathematical definitions, but still useful tools to describe data


### Application
1. A researcher is studying childrenâ€™s favorite colors. They label each color with a number -- for example, they record red as 1, blue as 2, green as 3, and so on. Later on, when they are analyzing their data, they find that the average favorite color is 2.78, and conclude that children like the color blue-green. Discuss the issues that led to this erroneous conclusion.
These are not ordinal data. 
You dont want to calculate the average value, you just want to count up the number of times that red was voted as favorite color, the number of times green was favorite color, the number of times blue was the favorite color, and the greatest of those 3 discrete values, is the favorite color amongst the children. You are looking for the mode color, not the average color. 

2. A researcher is studying student burnout. What questions might they want to ask, and what data would they record? What are possible analyses of this data, and how do those analyses depend on the data types?

How much sleep per night to you get. Test scores as sleep increase/decreases (graph them). Test scores as TV watching increase. Test scores as number of tests per week increases. Analyze these graphs to see if burnout decreases test scores. Logitudional data
