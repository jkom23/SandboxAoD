# Designing Experiments
Jack Komaroff
## Review
1. What is the difference between **independent** and **dependent** variables?
Independent is the variable that the experimenter will alter (maybe we cant change it, but it will still affect the dependent variable), the dependent variable is the variable that will change because of the independent variable
2. What is the difference between a **null** and **alternative** hypothesis?
The null hypothesis states that no relationship exists between two variables, the alternative hypothesis is that a relationship does exist between the two variables
3. How/why can experimental studies show causation?
We are changing an independent variable and we can see the dependent variable change, thus we can show that one thing CAUSES another (causation)
4. How might sampling bias affect the results of an experiment?
We might not not be including all members of the population in a balanced manner and thus our results are not the most accurate. Our sampling frame is unexpectadly differnt than our sample so our conclusion about the population is not accurate. 

## Designing an Experiment
1. Put these steps in the correct order:
     - Do background research (Also some more research is important after a precise question is formed)
     - Identify population
     - Identify independent and dependent variables / Identify **treatments** (can be specific version of independent variable)
     - Ask a precise question / Identify null and alternative hypotheses
     - Identify sample frame
     - Choose sampling method
     - Obtain sample to include in experiment
     - Conduct treatments on **control** and **experimental** groups
     - Draw conclusions/graphs/analysis
2. What are some examples of how an experiment can go wrong? Refer to specific steps from the list above.
If we choose a sampling method that doesnt include every nth bacteria in the petri dish and we just choose the 100 bacteria right under the light source, then our results are not going to be accurate because the bacteria that are father away from the light source were affected differently and those bacteria' characteristic were not accounted for in the experiment becuase the sample was not properly chosen
3. How might an error affect the trustworthiness of a study? How much *should* an error affect the trustworthiness of a study?
An error can cause the journal to not publish a study and thus the research isnt well known. this is the proper course of action because publishing incorrect data only makes it easier for people to ignore the science. 
4. What might a scientist do to prevent such errors?
Get their report thoroughly reviewed by experts and double check to make sure their experimental design is free of errors. 
5. What does it mean to **double blind** a study?
It means the experimenters and the subjects dont know who is in what group (treatment or control)
it can reduce errors and prevent bias
