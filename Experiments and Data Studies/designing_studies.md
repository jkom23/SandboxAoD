# Designing Studies
Jack Komaroff
## Review
1. What is the difference between a sample and a population?
A sample is the actual group of subjects we are testing, the population is the entire group of interest. Population can be much broader than the sample group. 

## Types of Studies
1. What is the difference between an **observational** and an **experimental** study?
Observational only examines the conditions that currently exist whereas experimental studies manipulate variables (takes some action) to see if causation are true, not simply correlation (which is common with observational studies)
Ex. Collect data between student stress level and number of classes that they are taking (observational)
Ex. RCTs (randomized controlled trials - experimental)
 

2. What is meant by the phrase "correlation, not causation"? Take a look at [Tyler Vigen's spurious correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) for some examples.
Correlation is when two events happen at the same time. Causation is when one event causes another to happen/not happen It is wednesday and I am sad. That is a correlation. We cant say that the fact that it is a wednesday CAUSES me to be sad. That would be a causation. 
Confounding factor can cause the two variables to be what they are, thus leading to a correlation not a causation
3. Why can't an observational study show causation?
It only shows that two events are currently happening at the same time. We are not doing any variable manipulation to see if this relationship holds as factors change. Ex. as days get closer to friday, my mood improves. That is causation. But just because we see that on friday I am happy, we cant say that the act of it being friday causes my happiness (an example of an observational study), we need to do an experiment and see the trend. 
4. What reasons might a researcher have for choosing one type of study over another?
Maybe they don't have the time/money to preform a complex experiment, even though experimental studies are required to prove causation, so they are generally better. Maybe we dont want to disturb an environment in nature, for example. 

## Sample Frame
1. What is a **sample frame**, and how is that different from a sample?
The list of all the subjects that you could take a sample from, all of the qualified subjects. Sample frame is smaller than the population. The sample is the actual chosen group of qualified subjects.
2. What does **coverage bias** (also called **exclusion bias**) mean in the context of choosing a sample frame?
We dont have a one to one ratio of sample subjects to population subjects, so we cant accuratly cover all of the subjects in our samples. That is why probablity sampling reduced coverage bias, because the demographic of the sample is most similar to that of the population
3. Suppose a researcher were studying the population of all students at Horace Mann.
   1. Give an example of a sample frame that demonstrates coverage bias.
   We only look at CS students
   2. What reasons might the researcher have for choosing that sample frame?
   Maybe the researcher was only looking to make an analysis of CS students
   3. What could the researcher do to reduce coverage bias?
   Sample students in humanities, math classes, science classes, etc.

## Sampling Methodology
1. What does it mean for a sample to be "good"?
A large n value and accuralty represents the population as well as the sample frame
2. What is the difference between **probability** and **nonprobability** sampling?
Probality sampling is when all members of the population have an equal chance of being in the sample, nonprobability sampling is easier and is just a group of subjucts of selected subjects that is not neccesarily representative of the population demographic
3. Give two examples of nonprobability sampling. What biases might these methods be prone to?
You select a group of people on the train and try to make a conclusion about the occupations of all new yorkers. This is not a random sampling so it isnt a proper mix of all new yorkers. Response rate is a bias, interviewer bias, etc, even if sampling is probablistic. No sample can ever be perfectly random/probalisitic
4. Give two examples of probability sampling. What biases might these methods be prone to?
If we send a form to every nth student at HM and ask for their thoughts on lunch options? The biases come from sorting, is this alphabetical, by age, gender, race? These sorting methods can cause bias. The best thing to do is make a randomized list of every HM student and choose the nth student from that list. 

## Practice
Choose one of the following situations:
  - **A 3rd grade teacher is interested in childhood literacy development. Theyâ€™ve noticed that some students tend to perform better when asked to do reading tasks. The teacher is curious about what reading activities these students are doing at home.**
  - An outdoor enthusiast recently went hiking, and found that some blueberries on the side of the trail were extremely sweet. However, other bushes on the same trail produced tasteless blueberries. The hiker is intrigued by what could be causing this difference.
  - An independent publisher is looking at printing presses to partner with. They are focused on newspapers and want to find a company that is experienced with newsprint paper. The publisher is thinking about what qualities to look for.

Then, for your chosen situation, write a response to the following:
1. Identify a statistical question you could ask in that situation.
2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?
3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.
4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?
5. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?

Does the hours spent doing reading activities at home cause increased reading test scores?
Population is all 3rd grade children who are currently learning to read. We should take into account lots of children from different backgrounds so we can make a more accurate conclusion that doens't depend on factors like poverty or home conditions/family structure.
We could ask teachers at various private, public, charter, and homeschools to survey their students about time spent on reading HW per night (in hours) and their test scores (as a percentage with 0% being the lowest and 100% as a perfect test score). That is our sample frame and it would not be too difficult to email the teachers for these answers. For our sampling method, I would collect the names of every 3rd grader at that school, and using probablity sampling, randomize the list and select every 100th student. This would give me many students from all the differnt school types and include students with differnt backgrounds, better than just a group of 200 HM 3rd graders or 200 PS36 3rd graders, this method covers more of the population. I would have a few thousand third graders' test scores and hours of reading HW per night. This will give me students from private schools, public schools, diffent genders, differnt races, etc. 

Then we can use these data points, crunch the numbers, and get a conclusion. 
We are slightly biased because our sample frame only includes NYC schools, so we have a coverage bias because we are excluding thousands of other cities in america (and those students who go to school there). With more money and time, we could make a larger sample frame and take random students from that longer list. But our initial procedure will yield valid results for major metropolitan cities as NYC is a very diverse city.
