Introduction to Data

Definitions

**Data** refers to *collections* of *observations* that are made by *people*.

1. Based on the definition above, list 3 things that may go wrong about data.
Cherry picking of subjects, leading questions, political agenda. 

Statistics

Suppose that you are a penguin researcher. Ideally, you would have access to and could study every single penguin on this planet.

1. Is studying every single penguin realistic or feasible? Why or why not?

Too many penguins to study.

2. What is an alternative to studying every single penguin?

A sampling of a few penguins for as many distinct habitats, species, and locations as possible.

3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your proposed alternative?

It isn't every penguin in existence but it accounts for more factors (ex. location, habitat, species) and can tell you general information about penguins/

**Statistics** is the study of *sample data* to describe or infer about a *population*.

1. In your own words, define **population** and **sample**. Use this penguin scenario as an example!

The population is every penguin in existence, the sample is the group of penguins that we have collected data about.

-9 squares
-all blue objects are squares
-squares are red, blue and purple
