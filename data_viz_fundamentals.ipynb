    "## Perception\n",
    "Read [this study by Christopher G. Healey](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/index.html). We will look at some of the experiments in class, but feel free to explore on your own as well.\n",

    "1. What is preattentive processing?\n",
    "   the ability for humans to quickly process information based on certain qualities. how humans can form conclusions before they even look at it consiously. we notice abberations from the norm\n",
    "2. What are some examples of preattentive visual features?\n",
    "   color, shape\n",
    "3. What happens to preattentive processing when there are multiple such features in the same image?\n",
    "   it becomes very hard to detect the \"hidden\" object; conjuction of these features makes detecting multiple abberations difficult. \n",
    "4. What is the theory of the feature hierarchy?\n",
    "   some features take presidence over others; they are more easily noticable\n",

    "Then, skim this [Wikipedia article on grouping]().\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are **gestalt** rules?\n",
    "   how the eyes perceive visual stimulus. Humans like to group close objects together and classify them as ONE OBJECT/or simple shapes. (proximity, color, closure, continuation, common fate, etc.)\n",
    "2. What do we mean by **perceptual distance**, and how might it be measured?\n",
    "   how we perceive how close objects are to each other. how we percieve how close/far objects are from each other. which features do these objects share. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. What are the differences between rods and cones?\n",
    "   they are both part of our retina: rods see in low light but cones have 3 cell types that see Red, green and blue (one for each type of cone).\n",
    "   rod cells take over in low light, so we cant really see color in the dark\n",
    "2. What is the difference between **additive** color and **subtractive** color?\n",
    "3. additive color is when shades of light are used to make colors, when subtractive color is when white light reflects off objects. \n",
    "      1. Which color model is used for electronic media?\n",
    "4.    additive\n",

    "   we use additive to create the print in the computer but when/if we print a graph it is subtractive "

    "\n",
    "1. What is a **scale**? Give some examples of how they are used.\n",
    "   A scale is a mapping function that map values to other values, so maybe 1 to 4 represents white to black; color ramps\n",
    "   heat maps and yellow to purple\n",
    "2. What **scale** might be appropriate to map different penguin species?\n",
    "   maybe we map them to 3 shapes and use that as the datapoints\n",
    "3. What **scale** might be appropriate to map penguin bill length?\n",
    "   maybe we can map it to color, light green is smaller lenghts and deep blue is longer \n",

    "2. Why is it not a good idea to map a single variable to more than one **channel**?\n",
    "   it becomes too diffficult to group the datapoints/marks together when they are being modified by more than one channel; adds confusion\n",
    "3. Explain how **channels** can be used to define a **scale**.\n",
    "   We can order channels accoridng to some scale (maybe size of point based on bill lenght) and that can define a scale (from smallest point to largest point, ex)\n",
    "   scale maps marks to channels based on some variable"
