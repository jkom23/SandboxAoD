Replication Crisis

The replication crisis is a major issue occurring in scientific fields.

Background

\1. What is the scientific method?

Make an observation.
Ask a question.
Form a hypothesis, or testable explanation.
Make a prediction based on the hypothesis.
Test the prediction.
Iterate: use the results to make new hypotheses or predictions.

\2. What is replication? How does it fit into the scientific method?
If we replicate the procedure of the experiment and we get the same results/same conclusion then the experiment is valid and accurate
\3. What is a scientific **hypothesis**?
A educated and informed prediction of the how the experiment will go
\4. What is the difference between a **null hypothesis** and an **alternative hypothesis**?
Null hypothesis is the prediction that no relationship exist, alternative hypothesis is the prediction that a relationship exists

The Issue

We will watch this video in class.

\1. What is the replication crisis?

\2. What are some issues with current scientific research?
You are motivated to publish false results
\3. What is **publish or perish**?

\4. What is **p-hacking**?
When you alter your  data or experiemnt to get a p value of <0.05
\5. What are some solutions to these issues?
Allowing replication studies to verify previous studies or reject them

Example

FiveThirtyEight has a great demonstration on p-hacking.

\1. What data points allow you to statistically claim that:

\1. Democrats have a positive effect on the economy.

\2. Democrats have a negative effect on the economy.

\3. Republicans have a positive effect on the economy.

\4. Republicans have a negative effect on the economy.

\2. Which statements above are backed by data and evidence? Which aren't?
